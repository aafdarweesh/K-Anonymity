Decisions for Generalization for adult.csv data:
1) Age: Intervals as it makes more sense as masking is not an option as it will give an indication
2) workclass: found that private category has many attributes, so I put it in a section and grouped the government together, and the rest in self-emp (will check it later, might need to add self-emp to government if they are very small)
3) fnlwgt "Final weight income": Intervals as masking will not be an option, as there is one entry with prefix 18*** (according to the data, the interval decided to be 10,000)
4) Education: Grouping together, to 3 main categories (school, uni, post grad)
5) Education Number: Interval of 10 as 9 & 10 have the highest numbers alone, and I want each to be in a separate group
6) Marital: to 3 categories according to the representation in the data, as devorced/widow/separated have relatively low each but related and around 30% together, the same apply for Maried. However, Nevermarries is already high ~30%
7) Occupation: Grouped into 3 : Technical, Non-Technical, Others
8) Relationship: Grouped into Spouse and Other. As Wife data was small in size and other-relatives
9) Race was generalized as some races are really really small in data size
10) Gender: was generalized to person
11) capital-gain: was identifier to some entries to cateforized as identifier
12) capital-loss: was identifier to some entries to cateforized as identifier
13) hours per week: was grouped into 2 categories as 40hours had 80% of the data
14) native country was categorized according to the Continent
15) Income: was categroized into two categorizes as it was.
